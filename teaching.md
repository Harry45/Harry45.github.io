<h1>Mathematics and Physics for HSC Students</h1>

<p align="justify">I'll briefly explain various topics in Mathematics, Further Mathematics and Physics for A-Level Students. I'll try to follow the CIE (Cambridge International Examination) syllabus as far as possible, but if you require any topic(s) to be explained urgently, feel free to drop me an email. I promise I'll upload the material as soon as possible.</p>
