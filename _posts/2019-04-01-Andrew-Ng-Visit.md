<p align="justify">On this day, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/andrewng">Professor Andrew Ng</a> was at Imperial College London. He was not only there as a speaker for the the (<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/">Data Science Institute, DSI</a>) Distinguished Lecture programme but to also commemorate the 5th year anniversary of the existence of the DSI.</p>

<p align="justify">It was not a big suprise to see the full lecture theatre completely full of postgraduate students, vehement to hear from Prof. Andrew. Somewhat surprising though, was the fact that Prof. Andrew came in with a yellow notebook rather than a laptop as we were all expecting some sort of digital presentation.</p>
