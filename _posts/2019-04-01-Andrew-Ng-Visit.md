<p align="justify">On this day, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/andrewng">Professor Andrew Ng</a> was at Imperial College London. He was not only there as a speaker for the the (<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/">Data Science Institute, DSI</a>) Distinguished Lecture programme but to also commemorate the 5th year anniversary of the existence of the DSI.</p>

<p align="justify">It was not a big suprise to see the full lecture theatre completely full of postgraduate students, vehement to hear from Prof. Andrew. Somewhat surprising though, was the fact that Prof. Andrew came in with a yellow notebook rather than a laptop as we were all expecting some sort of digital presentation. In fact, he chose to speak to the audience directly and use the white board to write a few important points. To me, this simple act, in itself, is an illustration of a true leader. He started off by speaking about his teaching courses at Stanford University. I personally think he is doing a fantastic job at revolutionalizing teaching methods. In particular, he refers to his own teaching system where students watch videos before coming to the class, and projects/ideas are discussed during teaching sessions. </p>

<p align="justify">	On the same note, since he is also trying to automate grading system as well, teaching and research assistants spend more time discussing projects/ideas with students. Other important topics discussed include but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><u>ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence)</u></li>
  <p align="justify">Up to now, there has been major development in supervised learning, where an algorithm is fed with thousands, possibly millions of examples before one tests on unseen examples. This form of Machine Learning is at the forefront of most technological application these days.</p>
  <li><u>AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)</u></li>
  <p align="justify">On the other hand, we are also far from achieving AGI - a state where an agent will be able to take decision on its own. Clearly, the human brain is a complicated system and although much work has been done in the Neuroscience research field, having a full understanding of how the brain works, remains a delicate topic of research.</p>
  <li>Small Data</li>
  <li>Generalizability</li>
  <p align="justify">Although, methods such as domain adaptation and transfer learning are currently being explored, Prof. Andrew believes that we are still far from</p>
  <li>AI as an Engineering Technique</li>
  <li>Jobs</li>
  <li>Education</li>
  <li>Creativity</li>
</ul>
