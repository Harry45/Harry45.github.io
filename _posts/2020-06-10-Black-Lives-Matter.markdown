<p align="justify">Since the death of George Floyd on the 25<sup>th</sup> May 2020 (see article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_George_Floyd">Wikipedia</a>), there has been ongoing protest not only in the US but all over the world, where people are expressing their concerns about systemic racism and unfair injustices on Black people. Growing up in Mauritius, which is a pluri-cultural and multi-ethinic society, I have a deep feeling and connection with this issue and hopefully, though this post, I will put forward some of my views on this.</p>
