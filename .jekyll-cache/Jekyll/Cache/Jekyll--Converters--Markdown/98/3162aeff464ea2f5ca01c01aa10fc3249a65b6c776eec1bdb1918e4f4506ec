<p align="justify">Prof. Alan Heavens is my PhD supervisor and we first met in the COSMO21 workshop organised in Greece in May 2016 and we met again during the Bayesian School held in Stellenbosch, South Africa in November 2016. Alan's work focuses on the application of Bayesian Statistics to analyse cosmological data. In particular, he uses these techniques to extract maximum information from data. He is also the father of the MOPED data compression algorithm which has been used extensively in the cosmology community and the very same algorithm has been applied in medical image analysis. He has also pioneered other research areas such as 3D weak lensing and Bayesian Hierarchical Models (BHM). I was lucky to work with on a nice project, which we referred to as MCEvidence. The latter enables us to calculate the Bayesian Evidence of a model, given that we already have MCMC samples generated from a sampler.</p>
