I"¥<p align="justify">Since the COVID-19 lockdown, we have had to adapt to a completely new paradigm, that is, 'working from home'. Although not encouraged prior to this pandemic, I have personally found that I have been quite efficient at multi-tasking. In this post, I will focus on the virtual workshops which I have attended (or will attend).  </p>

  <li><u>ICLR 2020</u> (26<sup>th</sup> April to 1<sup>st</sup> May, <a href="https://iclr.cc/virtual_2020/index.html"><i style="font-size:12px" class="fa">&#xf08e;</i></a>)</li>
	<p align="justify">I had the opportunity to present my work on Weak Lensing, Compression and Gaussian Processes (see <a href="https://slideslive.com/38926202/gaussian-processes-emulator-and-moped-for-weak-lensing">here</a>) at the ICLR 2020. Apart from my work, it was quite inspiring to see how Machine Learning has developed from a purely scientific field to an engineering field. Today, it encompasses almost all branch of Science and Engineering. One of the main focus was on Climate Change, which is undeniably one of the hardest problems that humanity is currently facing.</p>

  <li><u>MLSS 2020</u> (28<sup>th</sup> June to 10<sup>th</sup> July, <a href="http://mlss.tuebingen.mpg.de/2020/schedule.html"><i style="font-size:12px" class="fa">&#xf08e;</i></a>)</li>

  <p align="justify">Although I did not register for this workshop, we all had the opportunity to follow all talks live on Youtube. In particular, since my work is closely related to Bayesian Analysis, I was inspired by <a href="
https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/">Prof. Yee Whye Teh</a>s talks (Bayesian Inference I and II). Another topic which got me thinking was Meta-Learning by <a href="
https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/">Prof. Yee Whye Teh</a> in which he refers to the following:</p>
	<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><small><i>"Our training procedure is based on a simple machine learning principle: test and train
	conditions must match"</i> -

  <li>ICML 2020 (12<sup>th</sup> July to 18<sup>th</sup> July, <a href="https://icml.cc/virtual/2020"><i style="font-size:12px" class="fa">&#xf08e;</i></a>)</li>

  <li>OxML 2020 (17<sup>th</sup> August to 25<sup>th</sup> August, <a href="https://www.oxfordml.school/"><i style="font-size:12px" class="fa">&#xf08e;</i></a>)</li>

  <li>GPSS 2020 (14<sup>th</sup> September to 17<sup>th</sup> September, <a href="

<p align="justify">This would not have been possible if I were to be physically present, simply because the latter cost at least Â£200 while with the virtual workshops, it costs no more than Â£50. I understand that it is not the same as being part of an actual workshop but I personally think I have been able to make the most out of them.</p> -->
