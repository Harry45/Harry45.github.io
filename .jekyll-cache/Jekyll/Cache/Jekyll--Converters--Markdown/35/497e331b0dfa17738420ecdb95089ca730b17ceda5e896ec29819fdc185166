I"Ë<p align="justify">In this post, I will go through the steps I have personally found useful to do my research and lead the latter towards a publication. In general, the first paper (as first author) is always the most challenging part. It is through this process that I have learned how to think critically and to answer questions such as 'why is this research?', 'how do I manage my time properly?' and various others.</p>
