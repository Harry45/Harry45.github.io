I"2<p align="justify">Since the COVID-19 lockdown, we have had to adapt to a completely new paradigm, that is, 'working from home'. Although not encouraged prior to this pandemic, I have personally found that I have been quite efficient at multi-tasking. In this post, I will focus on the virtual workshops which I have attended (or will attend).  </p>

<p align="justify">This would not have been possible if I were to be physically present, simply because the latter cost at least £200 while with the virtual workshops, it costs no more than £50. I understand that it is not the same as being part of an actual workshop but I personally think I have been able to make the most out of them.</p> -->
