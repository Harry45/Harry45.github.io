I"Ì<p align="justify">In this post, I will go through the steps I have personally found useful to do my research and lead the latter towards a publication. In general, the first paper (as first author) is always the most challenging part. It is through this process that I have learned how to think critically and to answer questions such as 'why is this research important?', 'where is it going to be used', 'how is it different from previous work?', 'what are the new contributions to the field as a whole?', 'how do I manage my time properly?' and various others.</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Project definition</b></li>
	<p align="justify">In the very first step, we normally start with a project definition. However, there is always an element of risk when defining a project. Some friends of mine have confessed that their projects did not seem to be promising after spending a few months on them.</p>	
	<li>Brainstorming</li>

	<li><b>Identifying a main reference paper</b></li>
	<p align="justify">In general, finding a main reference paper is fundamental to the whole process. This implies understanding the paper, Mathematics and be able to implement (code) at least part of the paper.</p>
	<li><b>Fill in the gaps</b></li>

<p><b>Most Important Suggestions</b></p>

<ol>
	<li>Keep in touch with your supervisors (emails and weekly meetings).</li>
	<li>Have at least one mentor - I have found it easier to speak to my collaborator who is a Research Fellow.</li>
	<li>Always make notes - we are constantly living in a world with a wealth of information. It is important to channel ideas and information.</li>
	<li>Do not stick with yourself. In other words, don't pigeonhole yourself.</li>
	<li>Ask questions - there is no stupid question. I would like to share this wonderful quote:</li>
