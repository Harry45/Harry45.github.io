I"z<p align="justify">In this post, I will go through the steps I have personally found useful to do my research and lead the latter towards a publication. In general, the first paper (as first author) is always the most challenging part. It is through this process that I have learned how to think critically and to answer questions such as 'why is this research important?', 'where is it going to be used', 'how is it different from previous work?', 'what are the new contributions to the field as a whole?', 'how do I manage my time properly?' and various others.</p>
