<p align="justify"> I am currently enrolled for a Masters in Astrophysics and Space Science at the <a href="https://www.uct.ac.za/">University of Cape Town</a>. Having completed the coursework component of <a href="https://www.star.ac.za/">NASSP</a> (National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme), I am now completing the research part at <a href="https://www.aims.ac.za/">AIMS</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://cosmoaims.wordpress.com/2010/01/01/bruce-bassett/">Professor Bruce Bassett</a>.</p>

## Family
<p align="justify">I have an elder brother, a cute little brother and a lovely, beautiful little sister. My parents, who are my best mentors, have been very helpful and supportive. Moreover, as Henry Ward Beecher rightly said, "what a mother sings to the cradle goes all the way down to the coffin," my mother has provided me with both financial and moral support in all situations. </p>

## Early Life

<p align="justify">I was born on the 4<sup>th</sup> May 1991 in Mauritius, a tropic and stunning paradise island found in the Indian ocean. I grew up in a village named Goodlands which is found in the northern part. My father works in the construction industry while my mother is a housewife. My mother had the dream that we should all be well educated. As my elder brother is only one and a half year older than me, my mother insisted that I study together with him. Consequently, I started studying since I was 2 years old and I was enrolled in a local pre-primary school along with my elder brother. When I was 5 years old, I was admitted to a local primary school (SK Kanhye Government School) where I spent the next 6 years. </p>

<p align="justify">As my mother knew that this was a fundamental stage of my life, she would ensure that I was studying well at school. She would drop me at school everyday in the morning and would sometimes come to see me at mid-day. However, one thing which she would never miss was to bring hot milk for my elder brother and I at exactly 14 00 everyday. She is a strict and courageous woman. In short, she is always close to her children. Moreover, we had a shop in which I would be actively involved. For example, I would wake up early at 04 00, buy loaves from the bakery and sell them until 07 00. I became very good at doing mental calculations. In addition, when I was on the construction site with my father, I observed him doing all measurements with his measuring tape. I was surrounded with numbers and I started developing a strong liking for Mathematics.</p>

<p align="justify">I excelled for my CPE (Certificate of Primary Education) and I was then admitted to RPSSS (Ramsoondur Prayag State Secondary School), where I spent the next 5 years. To be honest, I was not so studious compared to other students at those times. I would play football a lot at school. However, I still loved my Mathematics and I would never miss my Mathematics, Additional Mathematics and Physics classes. I had already developed that strong zeal of studying Mathematics. On the 24<sup>th</sup> May 2006, my little brother was born. He became my best friend ever. As he is growing up, he is becoming quite mischievous but he studies well at school. I wonder how he manages to do that. After my SC (School Certificate) at RPSSS, I then moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_Port-Louis_(Mauritius)">RCPL</a> (Royal College Port Louis) for my HSC (High School Certificate), where I also performed well. It was the first time that I was exposed to such a cut-throat, competitive system.</p>

<p align="justify">Afterwards, it was hard to choose my undergraduate study. At that time, everybody would suggest their personal opinions, most of them being channelled towards becoming a doctor, an engineer or a lawyer. However, I knew my choice - either Mathematics or Physics. I decided to choose between these two only. I chose Physics (following the advice of my mother!) and I don't regret my choice. For my undergraduate study, we were fortunate that our lecturers taught us different facets of research. One day, we had the opportunity to have <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/oozeer-nadeem-100776b2">Dr Nadeem Oozeer </a>, who was visiting from <a href="http://www.ska.ac.za/">SKA SA</a> and he gave a nice overview of what the SKA will be in the African continent by 2022. At that time, I knew where I wanted to be! He later became my co-supervisor for my undergraduate project in which I scored the highest mark. At the end of 2014, I won the prestigious SKA SA Masters bursary to pursue further studies at the University of Cape Town. In the past year I have been fortunate to travel extensively internationally for workshops and conferences (refer to the section - <a href="https://harry45.github.io/travel/">travel</a>).</p>
